The code in the notebook is structured as follows and is aimed at building a loan prediction model and visualizing the results:

Imports and Setup:

Imports essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
Defines paths to the datasets.


Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loads the training dataset from a CSV file.
Removes the Loan_ID column as it is deemed unnecessary.
Visualizes correlations using a heatmap and pair plots.


Feature Engineering:

Defines numerical and categorical columns.
Uses ColumnTransformer to apply StandardScaler to numerical columns and OneHotEncoder to categorical columns.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.


Decision Tree Model:

Constructs a decision tree classifier pipeline.
Fits the model to the training data.
Predicts outcomes on the test set.
Evaluates the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Visualizes the decision tree.


Neural Network Model:

Constructs a neural network model using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
Adds layers including Dense and Dropout layers.
Compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
Trains the model on the training data.
Evaluates the model on the test data.
Predicts outcomes and evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Model Comparison:

Compares the performance of the Decision Tree and Neural Network models.
Prints accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports for both models.
Visualizes the neural network model architecture.
The code provides a comprehensive pipeline for loading data, preprocessing, training both a decision tree and a neural network model, and comparing their performance on a loan prediction task, along with data visualization.
