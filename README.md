Loan Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (LoanPM.ipynb) that implements a loan prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal of this model is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on several factors about the applicant, such as their income, marital status, education, number of dependents, and credit history.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes about the loan applicants and their loan approval status. The attributes include:

Loan_ID: Unique loan ID
Gender: Male/Female
Married: Applicant married (Yes/No)
Dependents: Number of dependents
Education: Applicant Education (Graduate/Undergraduate)
Self_Employed: Self-employed (Yes/No)
ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant
CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant
LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands
Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months
Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines
Property_Area: Urban/Semi Urban/Rural
Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N)

Notebook Content
The notebook includes the following steps:

Data Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and prepare it for modeling. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numeric ones, and normalizing the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand the distribution and relationship between different variables.
Model Building: Train various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Conclusion: Draw conclusions based on the model evaluations.
